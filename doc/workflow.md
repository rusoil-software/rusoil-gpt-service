# Workflow â€” completing work on the tasklist

Before starting any work, coordinate proposed solutions with relevant code sections and get approval. Once approved:

1. Implement the solution according to plan.
2. Test the implemented changes thoroughly to ensure they function as expected.
3. Document the changes made in the appropriate files (e.g., update `tasklist.md`, add tests, etc.).
4. Make a commit to the repository with a clear and concise commit message that explains the changes.
5. Wait for confirmation from the reviewer or team lead before proceeding to the next iteration.
6. Update the progress in the tasklist (mark completed tasks as done).
7. Coordinate the transition to the next iteration, if applicable.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 for each subsequent task.
