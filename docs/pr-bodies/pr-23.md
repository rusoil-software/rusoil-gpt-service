I read and followed doc/conventions.md

**Summary**
Implement simple API docs and OpenAPI polishing so the new endpoints are discoverable and easier for developers to use.

**What I changed**
- Added OpenAPI metadata (operation summaries and example responses) for the following endpoints:
  - `GET /health`
  - `GET /ready`
  - `GET /metrics`
  - `GET /api/v1/models`
  - `GET /api/v1/models/{name}`
- Added short, quick API docs in `docs/api.md` with curl examples and notes about environment variables (`METRICS_ENABLED`, `MODE`).
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new `docs/api.md` for quick examples.
- Hardened model path handling in `backend/app/main.py` to prevent path traversal by sanitizing filenames (`werkzeug.utils.secure_filename`), anchoring relative `MODEL_DIR` values to the repository root, and validating containment.
- Small workflow fix in `.github/workflows/pr-conventions-check.yml` to avoid re-declaring the `core` singleton in github-script embedded steps.

**Files touched (high level)**
- `backend/app/main.py` — OpenAPI metadata, enhanced models endpoints and hardened path handling
- `docs/api.md` — new short API docs with curl examples
- `README.md` — link to `docs/api.md`
- `tests/test_api.py` and `tests/test_openapi.py` — tests updated/added to assert OpenAPI presence and model metadata
- `.github/workflows/pr-conventions-check.yml` — workflow robustness fix

**Acceptance criteria mapping**
- FastAPI auto-generated docs include the required endpoints:
  - Verified `/openapi.json` contains `/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`, `/api/v1/models`.
- Metrics endpoint: exposed and documented with a read-only example in OpenAPI.
- Operation summaries and example responses added for the listed endpoints.
- `docs/api.md` includes how to call endpoints, example curl commands, and mentions `METRICS_ENABLED` and `MODE` env vars.
- Unit test `tests/test_openapi.py` confirms `/openapi.json` contains expected routes.

**How I tested locally**
1. Created a test model artifact under `models/test-model/model.ggml`.
2. Started the backend via the project's venv and uvicorn:

```powershell
& .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

3. Verified interactive docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and fetched `/openapi.json`:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json
```

4. Confirmed endpoints returned expected metadata:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/models
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/models/test-model
```

5. Ran test suite locally:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
# Result: all tests passed locally
```

**Security / safety notes**
- Model filename is sanitized via `secure_filename` and validated with a conservative regex.
- Resolved model paths are checked to ensure they are inside an allowed model directory.
- Metrics are gated by `METRICS_ENABLED` to avoid accidental exposure in production if undesired.

**Checklist**
- [x] I read and followed doc/conventions.md
- [x] Tests: added / updated unit tests where applicable (happy path + 1 edge case)
- [x] CI is green locally (all tests pass)
- [x] PR description explains the why (not just what)

No architectural changes were made.
